# hex-bareiss-mathlib (depends on hex-bareiss + hex-determinant-mathlib + Mathlib)

Mathlib bridge for `hex-bareiss`: proves the row-pivoted Bareiss determinant
correct against both Mathlib's determinant and our executable Leibniz
determinant, via the no-pivot bordered-minor invariant and the determinant
correspondence from `hex-determinant-mathlib`. The proofs are stated over an
arbitrary commutative coefficient ring with an exact quotient; `Int` is a
corollary, with no hypotheses beyond what it has today. The kernel
determinant certificate of hex-bareiss determines the determinant of a
Mathlib integer or rational matrix given as a row list, and the `det`
tactic closes determinant equalities on closed literals with it
([Kernel certificate](#kernel-certificate), [The `det` tactic](#the-det-tactic)).

This library owns no runtime search, conformance driver or compiled
benchmark. Its proof-side surface, the `det` tactic, is measured by the
fresh-module probes under `bench/HexBareissMathlib/ProofProbe` against the
unmodified pinned `eval_det`. Build-only examples live in
`HexBareissMathlib/Tests.lean`.

## Coefficient contract

The Bareiss correspondence theorems take `[CommRing R] [DecidableEq R]` (Mathlib's `CommRing`,
which supplies the `Lean.Grind.CommRing` instance the Mathlib-free layer's
`Hex.Matrix.det` needs) together with the exact quotient and its single law,
exactly as specified in
[hex-bareiss §Coefficient contract](https://github.com/leanprover/hex-bareiss/blob/main/SPEC/hex-bareiss.md):

```lean
(quot : R → R → R) (hquot : ∀ a b : R, b ≠ 0 → quot (a * b) b = a)
```

These correspondence theorems have no public `IsDomain`, `NoZeroDivisors`
or nontriviality hypothesis. The
coefficient facts the development needs are supplied by
[`HexBasic/ExactDiv.lean`](https://github.com/leanprover/hex-basic/blob/main/HexBasic/ExactDiv.lean)
and apply under a Mathlib `CommRing`: the two instance paths to `Zero R` and
`Mul R` agree, so `[CommRing R] [Div R] [Hex.ExactDivLaws R]` is a usable binder
list with no diamond to work around.

Those lemmas are stated over `[Div R] [Hex.ExactDivLaws R]`, though, and the
generic theorems here carry only the unbundled `quot` and `hquot`. They do not
apply directly; the package is built locally inside each proof that needs it:

```lean
letI : Div R := ⟨quot⟩
haveI : Hex.ExactDivLaws R := ⟨hquot⟩
```

The derived facts (`mul_ne_zero`, `mul_right_cancel`) do not mention `/`, so the
local `Div` never escapes into a statement.

**One `IsDomain` instance is constructed, not assumed.**
`det_eq_zero_of_bareiss_failed_column` closes the failed-pivot branch through
Mathlib's `Matrix.exists_mulVec_eq_zero_iff`, which is stated for
`[CommRing A] [IsDomain A]`. In the nontrivial branch:

```lean
theorem isDomain_of_quot [CommRing R] (quot : R → R → R)
    (hquot : ∀ a b : R, b ≠ 0 → quot (a * b) b = a) (h1 : (1 : R) ≠ 0) :
    IsDomain R
```

built from `Nontrivial R` (out of `h1`) and `NoZeroDivisors R` (out of the
derived `mul_ne_zero`), then `NoZeroDivisors.to_isDomain`. It is a `haveI`
inside that one proof and never a binder on a public statement, which is what
makes "no public `IsDomain` hypothesis" true rather than a slogan.

`Int.mul_eq_zero` is the only named `Int` lemma this library uses today. Three
further places rely on `Int` being concrete, and each has a replacement:

| site | today | generic replacement |
|---|---|---|
| `borderedMinor_zero_column_succ_det_eq_zero_of_entries` | `Int.mul_eq_zero` on `det(borderedMinor) * prevPivot = 0` | `Hex.ExactDivLaws.mul_right_cancel` against `0 * prevPivot` |
| `bareissNoPivotInvariant_initial` | `decide` for `(1 : Int) ≠ 0` | hypothesis `(1 : R) ≠ 0`, plus a trivial-ring case split at each public theorem |
| `bareissNoPivot_eq_det` sign step | `decide` for `(if 0 % 2 = 0 then 1 else -1) = 1` | `rfl` after the `rowSwaps = 0` rewrite; not `Int`-specific in substance |
| `failedBareissColumn_at_pivot` | `norm_num` for `(-1 : Int) ^ (k + k) = 1` | `pow_mul` and `neg_one_sq` over any `CommRing` |

The no-zero-divisor property, where the development needs it, is
`Hex.ExactDivLaws.mul_ne_zero`.

**The nontriviality seed.** `BareissNoPivotInvariant` asserts
`prevPivot ≠ 0`, and the initial state has `prevPivot = 1`, so
`bareissNoPivotInvariant_initial` and `bareissPivotInvariant_initial` each gain
a hypothesis `(1 : R) ≠ 0`. It is not pushed onto the public theorems: each
opens with `by_cases h1 : (1 : R) = 0`, and in the trivial branch every element
of `R` is `0` (`by_contra` plus `Hex.one_ne_zero_of_nonzero`), so both sides of
the correctness statement are `0`:

```lean
theorem eq_zero_of_one_eq_zero [CommRing R] (h1 : (1 : R) = 0) (a : R) : a = 0 := by
  by_contra ha
  exact Hex.one_ne_zero_of_nonzero ha h1
```

Nothing is added to the shared exact-division package for this.

## No-pivot invariant and core correctness

```lean
def NonzeroBareissPivots [CommRing R] (M : Hex.Matrix R n n) : Prop :=
  ∀ k : Fin n,
    Hex.Matrix.det
      (Hex.Matrix.principalSubmatrix M (k.val + 1) (Nat.succ_le_of_lt k.isLt)) ≠ 0

structure BareissNoPivotInvariant [CommRing R]
    (source : Hex.Matrix R n n) (state : Hex.Matrix.BareissState R n) : Prop

theorem bareissNoPivotWith_eq_det [CommRing R] [DecidableEq R]
    (quot : R → R → R) (hquot : ∀ a b : R, b ≠ 0 → quot (a * b) b = a)
    (M : Hex.Matrix R n n) (h : NonzeroBareissPivots M) :
    Hex.Matrix.bareissNoPivotWith quot M = Matrix.det (matrixEquiv M)
```

`NonzeroBareissPivots` is unchanged in content: every leading principal minor up
to size `n` is nonzero.

`BareissNoPivotInvariant` stays **quotient-independent**. Its five fields
(`singular_none`, `step_le`, `prevPivot_eq`, `prevPivot_ne`, `trailing_eq`) are
purely relational between `source` and `state`, and the state stores no
quotient, so parameterizing the invariant by `quot` would add an argument no
field mentions. `quot` and `hquot` belong on the step and loop *preservation*
lemmas, which are the statements that actually run `stepMatrixWith quot`.

## Headline correspondence theorems

The preferred surface for downstream Mathlib-side callers:

```lean
theorem bareissWith_eq_det [CommRing R] [DecidableEq R]
    (quot : R → R → R) (hquot : ∀ a b : R, b ≠ 0 → quot (a * b) b = a)
    (M : Hex.Matrix R n n) :
    Hex.Matrix.bareissWith quot M = Hex.Matrix.det M

theorem bareissWith_eq_mathlib_det [CommRing R] [DecidableEq R]
    (quot : R → R → R) (hquot : ∀ a b : R, b ≠ 0 → quot (a * b) b = a)
    (M : Hex.Matrix R n n) :
    Hex.Matrix.bareissWith quot M = Matrix.det (matrixEquiv M)
```

Neither carries a nondegeneracy hypothesis: row pivoting handles the singular
case, and the zero-pivot branch is turned into `det M = 0` rather than being
excluded. `bareissWith_eq_mathlib_det` is `bareissWith_eq_det` composed with
`det_eq` (from `hex-determinant-mathlib`), so it holds outright.

**`Int` corollaries.** Today's four public theorems keep their names and
statements verbatim, and gain no new coefficient hypotheses.
`bareissNoPivot_eq_det` keeps the `NonzeroBareissPivots` premise it already has;
the other three remain premise-free:

```lean
theorem bareissNoPivot_eq_det (M : Hex.Matrix Int n n) (h : NonzeroBareissPivots M) :
    Hex.Matrix.bareissNoPivot M = Matrix.det (matrixEquiv M)

theorem bareiss_eq_mathlib_det (M : Hex.Matrix Int n n) :
    Hex.Matrix.bareiss M = Matrix.det (matrixEquiv M)

theorem bareissDet_eq_det (M : Hex.Matrix Int n n) :
    Hex.Matrix.bareiss M = Matrix.det (matrixEquiv M)

theorem bareiss_eq_det (M : Hex.Matrix Int n n) :
    Hex.Matrix.bareiss M = Hex.Matrix.det M
```

The first two are in `HexBareissMathlib/Bareiss.lean`; `bareissDet_eq_det` and
`bareiss_eq_det` are in the umbrella `HexBareissMathlib.lean`, which is where
they must stay.

Each is the generic theorem instantiated at `quot := Hex.Matrix.exactDiv`, whose
law is `Int.mul_ediv_cancel`. `Hex.Matrix.bareiss` is by definition
`bareissWith Hex.Matrix.exactDiv`, so these are applications, not restatements.
Nothing downstream (`HexGramSchmidtMathlib/Update.lean`,
`HexGramSchmidtMathlib/Int/RowAdd.lean`) needs to change.

**Other carriers.** No carrier-specific determinant correspondence theorem is
needed. At every supported carrier, the only extra proof supplied at the use
site is the exact-quotient law

```lean
fun a b hb => Hex.exactDiv_mul_right a hb
```

with instances obtained as follows:

| carrier | source of `[Div R] [Hex.ExactDivLaws R]` | additional assumptions |
|---|---|---|
| `Rat` | core division plus `Hex.instExactDivLawsField` | none |
| `ZMod64 p` | `HexPolyFp.PrimeField` plus `Hex.instExactDivLawsField` | `[ZMod64.Bounds p] [ZMod64.PrimeModulus p]` |
| `DensePoly F` | polynomial division and `Hex.instExactDivLawsDensePoly` from `HexResultant.ExactDiv` | `[Lean.Grind.Field F] [DecidableEq F]` |
| `ZPoly` | the same dense-polynomial instance over `Hex.instExactDivLawsInt` | none |
| `MvPoly n R cmp` | `Hex.MvPoly.instDiv` and `Hex.MvPoly.instExactDivLaws` from `HexMvGcd.Divide` | the lawful coefficient-GCD and monomial-order context listed in the `hex-bareiss` carrier table |

These instance-law terms are compile-time guards in the carrier integration
modules, not new correspondence APIs in this library. The already-generic
`bareissWith_eq_mathlib_det` is the sole theorem needed once both a Mathlib
`CommRing` and the `hquot` term are in scope; it must not be duplicated under
carrier-specific theorem names. `Rat` and `MvPoly` already have the necessary
Mathlib structures. Executable `DensePoly`/`ZPoly` and `ZMod64` do not currently
have global Mathlib `CommRing` instances, so their computational conformance is
independent of that separate bridge work; this SPEC does not invent local
instances or weaken the theorem to claim otherwise.

These are the theorems on the forbidden list in the Mathlib-free `hex-bareiss`
SPEC: they must live here, never restated or reproven in the executable layer.
The forbidden list is about the *statement shape*, not the coefficient ring: a
Mathlib-free `bareissWith quot M = det M` at any carrier, `Int` included, is
still forbidden below this layer.

## Determinant identity boundary

The only determinant identity consumed is
`HexMatrixMathlib.desnanot_jacobi_borderedMinor`, in `CorePlucker.lean`, which
is already stated over an arbitrary Mathlib `CommRing` with no nondegeneracy
hypothesis. **The generalization requires no change to
`hex-determinant-mathlib`'s identity surface**, and must not introduce a second
determinant identity development. The general Sylvester identity stays absent
and stays unnecessary: fraction-free elimination uses only the `2 × 2`
bordered-minor case, which *is* Desnanot-Jacobi. See
[hex-determinant-mathlib §Sylvester's determinant identity: absent](https://github.com/leanprover/hex-determinant-mathlib/blob/main/SPEC/hex-determinant-mathlib.md).

One declaration next to it does need generalizing rather than duplicating:
`HexMatrixMathlib.bareissExactDiv_borderedMinor_of_mul_eq` in `CorePlucker.lean`
is a thin `Int` re-export of the Mathlib-free
`Hex.Matrix.bareissExactDiv_borderedMinor_of_mul_eq`, which packages the
Desnanot-Jacobi product identity as the `hexact` premise of
`Hex.Matrix.stepMatrix_borderedMinor_update`. In generic form it takes `quot`
and `hquot` in place of the fixed `exactDiv`, and `prevPivot ≠ 0` remains the
only nondegeneracy hypothesis anywhere in this surface:

```lean
theorem exactQuot_borderedMinor_of_mul_eq [CommRing R]
    (quot : R → R → R) (hquot : ∀ a b : R, b ≠ 0 → quot (a * b) b = a)
    (source : Hex.Matrix R n n) (k : Nat) (hk : k < n) (hnext : k + 1 < n)
    (i j : Fin n) (hi : k < i.val) (hj : k < j.val) (prevPivot : R)
    (hprev_ne : prevPivot ≠ 0)
    (hdesnanot : det (borderedMinor source (k + 1) hnext i j) * prevPivot = …) :
    quot … prevPivot = det (borderedMinor source (k + 1) hnext i j)
```

Its `Int` instantiation keeps the existing name, so `HexGramSchmidtMathlib`'s
use of the surrounding lemmas is unaffected. Renaming away from
`bareissExactDiv…` is deliberate: the operation is no longer fixed to
`exactDiv`, and a five-qualifier name that restates its call site is the naming
smell the project conventions call out.

Because that declaration is described by name in
[hex-determinant-mathlib §Desnanot-Jacobi: the four public forms](https://github.com/leanprover/hex-determinant-mathlib/blob/main/SPEC/hex-determinant-mathlib.md),
the implementation owes that SPEC a matching amendment. It is deliberately not
amended ahead of the code: today it describes what is actually there.

Both `CorePlucker.lean` consumers of `desnanot_jacobi_borderedMinor`
(`HexBareissMathlib/Bareiss.lean` and `HexGramSchmidtMathlib/Int/Augmented.lean`)
continue to work: the second stays at `Int` and picks up the corollary.

## Kernel certificate

`HexBareissMathlib/Kernel.lean` proves the kernel certificate of
[hex-bareiss §The kernel certificate](../../HexBareiss/SPEC/hex-bareiss.md#the-kernel-certificate)
sound for `Matrix.det` over `ℤ` and `ℚ`, stated on the Mathlib matrix of a
row list (`ofLists`, from the literal layer of
[hex-matrix-mathlib](../../HexMatrixMathlib/SPEC/hex-matrix-mathlib.md#matrix-literals)):

```lean
theorem det_eq_of_checkList (n) (L : List (List Int)) (c : DetWitness)
    (h : checkDetList n L c = true) : (ofLists n n L).det = c.value
theorem det_eq_of_checkList' (A : Matrix (Fin n) (Fin n) ℤ) (L) (c)
    (hA : A = ofLists n n L) (h : checkDetList n L c = true) : A.det = c.value
theorem det_eq_of_checkRat (n) (L : List (List Rat)) (s : List Nat) (B) (c) (v : Rat)
    (h : checkDetRat n L s B c v = true) : (ofLists n n L).det = v
theorem det_eq_of_checkRat' (A : Matrix (Fin n) (Fin n) ℚ) (L) (s) (B) (c) (v)
    (hA : A = ofLists n n L) (h : checkDetRat n L s B c v = true) : A.det = v
```

The proof follows the certificate. Each recorded swap is a transposition
of two rows below `n`, and `ofLists` of the swapped list is the submatrix
along `Equiv.swap`, so `det_permute` and `sign_swap` give
`det (ofLists (applySwaps s L)) = signOf s · det (ofLists L)` by induction
on the swaps. The transform rows define `Lm i k = (T.getD i []).getD k 0`,
lower triangular because row `i` has length `i + 1`
(`IsLowerTriangular`, `det_of_isLowerTriangular`); the walk's
specification `triangularCheck_spec`, by induction on the rows, gives the
zero products below the diagonal, so `Lm * ofLists n n P` is upper
triangular (`det_of_isUpperTriangular`), and the accumulated identity
`(∏ lᵢ) · d = sign · ∏ uᵢ`. With `det_mul`, `sign² = 1` and `∏ lᵢ ≠ 0`
(`Finset.prod_ne_zero_iff`, `mul_left_cancel₀`) the value is
`det (ofLists n n L)`. A left kernel vector `v` gives
`(fun i => v.getD i 0) ᵥ* ofLists n n L = 0` with a nonzero coordinate,
and `exists_vecMul_eq_zero_iff` gives `det = 0`. The passage from lists to
sums is `dotInt_eq_sum` (a dot product stopping at the shorter list is a
sum over any `Fin r` with `r` at least the first list's length, the
`getD` defaults supplying the zeros) with `column_getD` and `columns_getD`
for the transposition. For `ℚ`, `scaledRows_spec` gives
`diagonal s * ofLists n n L = (ofLists n n B).map Int.cast`, so
`det_diagonal`, `det_mul` and `Int.cast_det` turn the integer theorem into
`(∏ s) · det = value`, and the kernel-checked `v · ∏ s = value` cancels the
nonzero product (`prodNat_cast`).

## Symbolic determinant

The symbolic handler is specified in
[hex-poly-det-mathlib](../../SPEC/Libraries/hex-poly-det-mathlib.md). It attaches
to this library's determinant syntax and uses a cached, division-free Bird
recurrence with scalar equality proofs. It is independent of the polynomial
witness instantiation. Keep symbolic normalization outside this numeric library;
its published import closure must not acquire polynomial/reflection providers.
The generic executable polynomial witness remains a separate hex-bareiss API.

## The `det` tactic

`HexBareissMathlib/Tactic.lean` declares the non-reserved tactic keyword
`det`, closing `A.det = d` and `d = A.det` for `A : Matrix (Fin n) (Fin n) R`
with `R` either `ℤ` or `ℚ`, a closed literal in one of the four syntaxes
of the literal layer of `hex-matrix-mathlib` (`!![…]`, `Matrix.of ![…]`,
`fun i j => …`, `Matrix.ofArray xs h`), possibly behind definitions
(unfolded within a small budget), and `d` a closed value; the term form
`det% A` returning `Certified Matrix.det A` with its `value` and `proof`
(the `!![…]` notations are given an integer expectation); and the simproc
`Hex.norm_det`, which rewrites `Matrix.det A` using a Hex certificate and
leaves unsupported inputs unchanged. No entry point implicitly invokes
Mathlib's `norm_det` or `eval_det`. Entries are
closed numeric expressions that `norm_num` evaluates (the `fun` form's
entries first pass through the default simp set, for `Fin.val`, casts and
`if i = j` tests) and that the kernel reduces to their numerals.

The tactic evaluates the entries, runs the compiled `detWitnessOfLists`,
quotes the witness with `toExpr`, and builds
`det_eq_of_checkList' A L c hA (of_decide_eq_true rfl)` with `hA` the
literal's identification with its row list (`rfl` for a vector chain, one
kernel `decide` on `entriesEq` otherwise), composed with a kernel-decided
comparison of the value with `d`. A rational matrix is scaled row by row by
the least common multiple of its denominators to an integer one, whose
witness is checked by `checkDetRat` together with the scaling and the
value, through `det_eq_of_checkRat'`. The tactic takes the shared
configuration structure `HexMatrixMathlib.Det.Config`, extending
`HexMatrixMathlib.KernelConfig`, as an `optConfig`
(`det -packing`; the default is packed) and is configured in no other way;
with packing on the checks are `checkDetListPacked` and `checkDetRatPacked`
with the entry bound and slot width the tactic computes from the entries
and the transform, through `det_eq_of_checkListPacked'` and
`det_eq_of_checkRatPacked'`. The term form `det%` and the simproc
`Hex.norm_det` use the default configuration. The whole proof is added as an
auxiliary lemma on the closed target (`addClosedProof` of the literal
layer, with asynchronous checking off) so the kernel checks it exactly
once, with no elaborator type check first, and the tactic sees a
rejection. Outcomes
follow the protocol of [SPEC/matrix-tactics.md](../../SPEC/matrix-tactics.md):
before evaluating entries or running the producer, a goal outside determinant
equalities, an open matrix or value (including unresolved metavariables),
a carrier other than `ℤ` or `ℚ`, a non-square shape, or an unrecognized
literal is `notApplicable`. The numeric tactic throws
`throwUnsupportedSyntax` for those cases. The last-resort handler is
registered **before** the numeric one, so Lean's reverse registration order
tries it **after** the numeric one and any later extensions. Extensions
must also use `@[no_fallback]` for their own errors and
`throwUnsupportedSyntax` outside their fragments. It reclassifies
the target and, for determinant equations, tries `simp only [Hex.norm_det]`
before reporting `det: not applicable: …` with the reason. This can normalize
a closed numeric determinant with an open target value using a Hex certificate,
leaving a residual value equality. This simp-only diagnostic behavior is for the
numeric-only import. With the
symbolic companion imported, equality goals with numeric matrices and symbolic
right-hand sides obtain the numeric certificate and use the companion's scalar
comparison, closing or reporting a decline instead of leaving a residual goal.
Symbolic matrices and unsupported carriers require a Hex extension or an explicit
user invocation of another tactic.

An entry or closed value that cannot be evaluated is still declined with
the reason; the numeric handler retains the same Hex certificate normalization for these
capability declines. Its `@[no_fallback]` attribute commits ordinary errors,
so producer failures, rejected certificates and budget errors cannot be
masked by a later tactic handler. Unsupported syntax still delegates.
Hex certificate normalization propagates errors unchanged, including certificate errors
from its simproc; it reports the original reason only when simp makes no
progress.
The `det%` form reports the classification reason directly; the simproc
returns no result for either inapplicability or a capability decline.
A false target is reported with the certified value
before any proof is built; a rejection by the kernel is diagnosed by
evaluating the certificate check and the identification of the literal in
turn, and reported as a producer bug or an entry the kernel cannot
reduce. Accepted theorems depend on `propext`, `Classical.choice` and
`Quot.sound` only.

**Comparator.** The unmodified pinned `eval_det` (Bird's algorithm with a
certificate chain normalized by `ring`) is the comparator. The
fresh-module probes `bench/HexBareissMathlib/ProofProbe/{Dense8, Dense12,
Dense16, Dense32, Tridiagonal16, Vandermonde8, Singular16, Large8Bits64,
Large4Bits256, Rational8}{Hex,Mathlib}.lean`, written by
`scripts/bench/det_tactic_probes.py`, prove the same seeded literal by
`det` and by `eval_det`, each against its import-only baseline
(`Baseline`, `MathlibBaseline`); `scripts/bench/det_tactic_sweep.py` runs
them through `fresh_module_sweep.py` (six samples, adjacent pairs,
alternating orientation). Each arm's delta is an absolute estimate of its
proof cost, literal elaboration included; the family's comparator ratio is
the ratio of the two medians and is only as resolved as the smaller delta.
`dense-32` has no `eval_det` arm: Bird's algorithm does not finish it
within the `120 s` budget. Medians from
`reports/bench-results/hex-bareiss-mathlib-tactic-probes-eed5c4c60624-chungus2.json`
(shared host, one CPU, both arms with the literal's elaboration inside
the delta):

| family | `eval_det` | `det` | ratio |
|---|---|---|---|
| dense `8 × 8`, 8-bit | 0.51 s | 0.16 s | 3.3 |
| dense `12 × 12`, 8-bit | 3.55 s | 0.30 s | 11.7 |
| dense `16 × 16`, 8-bit | 18.8 s | 0.52 s | 36 |
| dense `32 × 32`, 8-bit | over budget, no arm | 3.71 s | |
| tridiagonal `16 × 16` | 4.40 s | 0.40 s | 10.9 |
| Vandermonde `8 × 8`, leading zero | 0.40 s | 0.11 s | 3.6 |
| singular `16 × 16`, rank `15` | 18.8 s | 0.32 s | 59 |
| dense `8 × 8`, 64-bit | 0.60 s | 0.15 s | 4.0 |
| dense `4 × 4`, 256-bit | 0.11 s | 0.09 s | 1.2 |
| rational `8 × 8` | 0.69 s | 0.20 s | 3.5 |

Proof time against dimension, for the dense `8`-bit, singular (rank
`n − 1`) and dense `64`-bit families up to a ten-second cap per run, in
three arms (`eval_det`, `det`, and `det -packing` for the plain checker on
the same certificate), is
recorded by `scripts/bench/det_tactic_size_sweep.py` (profiler totals per
file, imports excluded, the median of three runs per point with the range
kept); the current record is
`reports/bench-results/hex-bareiss-mathlib-tactic-size-2232712e8c2f-chungus2.json`.
`eval_det` reaches `n = 14` in every family (7.1, 8.2 and 8.3 s) and `det`
reaches `n = 48` on the dense family (2.2 s, of which the kernel is
1.4 s), `n = 48` on the singular family (1.2 s, kernel 0.3 s) and
`n = 24`, the end of its ladder, on the 64-bit family (0.6 s, kernel
0.4 s); `det -packing` reaches the same dimensions at 4.4, 1.2 and 0.7 s.
The record is plotted by
`scripts/plots/hex-bareiss-mathlib-tactic-size.py` to
`reports/figures/hex-bareiss-mathlib-tactic-size.svg`.

Median kernel shares recorded by the same size sweep are:

| family | `eval_det` | `det` | `det -packing` |
|---|---|---|---|
| dense `8 × 8`, 8-bit | 250 ms | 28 ms | 18 ms |
| dense `12 × 12`, 8-bit | 1.51 s | 54 ms | 44 ms |
| dense `14 × 14`, 8-bit | 3.26 s | 74 ms | 66 ms |
| dense `16 × 16`, 8-bit | timeout | 113 ms | 111 ms |
| dense `32 × 32`, 8-bit | not run | 549 ms | 936 ms |
| dense `40 × 40`, 8-bit | not run | 845 ms | 2.00 s |
| singular `8 × 8` | 239 ms | 10 ms | 10 ms |
| singular `16 × 16` | timeout | 31 ms | 30 ms |
| singular `32 × 32` | not run | 146 ms | 140 ms |
| singular `48 × 48` | not run | 335 ms | 333 ms |
| dense `8 × 8`, 64-bit | 288 ms | 30 ms | 20 ms |
| dense `16 × 16`, 64-bit | timeout | 133 ms | 124 ms |
| dense `24 × 24`, 64-bit | not run | 396 ms | 423 ms |

A timeout entry has no profiler breakdown because the corresponding proof
exceeded the sweep's wall limit (the import baseline plus the cap plus one
second), and a "not run" entry is a dimension
the arm never reached because its family had already stopped.

Determinants on `Hex.Matrix` inputs, finite and closed algebraic carriers
and symbolic entries are out of scope here
([SPEC/matrix-tactics.md §Placement](../../SPEC/matrix-tactics.md#placement)).

## Result production and shared syntax

Declare `det A with d hd` beside the existing `det` and `det% A` syntax kinds.
It accepts the same `optConfig` before `A`, computes the certified numeric value
once, introduces a local definition `d` with that value and `hd : A.det = d`,
and leaves the ambient goal available. Both identifiers are explicit. Reuse the
same certificate producer and proof construction as the term form; do not invent
a target or call the closing tactic to discover a value. Extensions handle
symbolic inputs on the same syntax kind and preserve committed errors.

`HexMatrixMathlib.Det.Config` keeps `packing := true`, with `det -packing`
unchanged, and adds `maxHeartbeats := 2000000` and `maxRelationWork := 1000000`
for the symbolic handler. These fields do not change numeric certificate
selection; the numeric backend retains its own existing budgets. Use structure
configuration, not experimental global options. `det% A` and simprocs use defaults;
a programmatic result operation accepts explicit configuration.

The public record remains `Certified Matrix.det A` with `value` and `proof`.
An expected determinant answer is never required for the result forms. Preserve
integer defaulting for unannotated numeric literals, and respect explicit
carrier annotations and expected record types. An imported symbolic extension
classifies the matrix first: closed numeric
matrices always use numeric certificate computation. Whole equality-tactic
delegation also requires that the numeric closing handler accept the supplied
target; otherwise the companion compares the numeric certified value against
the symbolic target. Result forms delegate before symbolic work. Neither matrix
shape nor a failed scalar comparison selects another determinant algorithm.

Use Lean's public heartbeat units for `maxHeartbeats` (1,000 internal heartbeats
per unit). The symbolic ceiling cannot enlarge the ambient remaining allowance;
zero configuration limits reject explicitly. The fields have no effect on
numeric certificates, including when non-default, and do not produce a warning.
See the companion contract for the distinction between recoverable work-budget
declines and propagated runtime resource exceptions.

The numeric owner exposes `compute (cfg : Config) (A : Expr) : MetaM (Outcome Result)`
and a `certified` adapter, with `Result.value` and `Result.proof`. Provide one
symbolic extension hook; keep the default numeric implementation available alone.
The argument-taking tactic uses `colGt term:max` before `with`, and has its own
named syntax kind and final diagnostic handler. Use `HexMatrix.certificate` for
route and budget traces.

## Tests

`HexBareissMathlib/Tests.lean`, build-only:

- `checkDetList` on a hand-written `2 × 2` triangular witness and on a
  hand-written singular witness, discharged by `decide +kernel`, and
  `det_eq_of_checkList` on each, concluding `det (ofLists 2 2 L) = -2` and
  `= 0`;
- the `det` tactic in both orientations on a `3 × 3` example behind a
  definition and inline, on the four literal syntaxes (including a `fun`
  form behind a definition), on compound entries, the empty and `1 × 1`
  matrices, rational entries (a proper fraction, integers written in `ℚ`,
  a singular rational matrix), odd and even dimensions with pivot swaps, a
  `5 × 5` matrix with a late swap, singular inputs of every kind, and a
  `16 × 16` literal with `8`-bit entries;
- `det%` on a definition, inline and on a rational literal, and its
  `proof` field closing the determinant equation;
- `simp only [Hex.norm_det]` on integer and rational literals; both the simproc
  and tactic reject unsupported symbolic and `ZMod 7` inputs even with
  Mathlib's `norm_det` imported; the caller can invoke Mathlib explicitly;
- the messages on a false target, a closed non-literal and a goal that is
  not a determinant equation, plus open-matrix and open-value diagnostics
  without a test stub (`#guard_msgs`);
- numeric-first dispatch to a test stub for open matrices and values, other
  carriers, unrecognized literals and unrelated goals, with the handler order
  asserted explicitly; numeric successes and false-target errors precede the
  stub;
- `Hex.Matrix.det` and the bare `det` identifier still usable on
  `Hex.Matrix`;
- the axiom audit of a `16 × 16` determinant proved by `det`.

These are not an independent oracle. The conformance stream of `HexBareiss`
is.
